**Directory Organizer - Khizar Malik**
Summary:

This program organizes files in the downloads folder or any directory specified by the user. It moves files into their respective folders (e.g., images, documents, music, videos) based on their file extensions.

Instructions:

Default (Downloads Folder):
- Run the program and answer 'yes' when prompted to organize the downloads folder.
Custom Directory:
- If you want to organize a different folder, answer 'no' when prompted.
- Use the command prompt or terminal to navigate to the desired directory.
- Type pwd to find the directory path (or use cd commands to change directories).
- Copy this path and paste it into the program when asked.
Notes:
- Ensure the destination folders (like 'Pictures' or 'Documents') exist or will be automatically created.
- The program will handle file organization safely, ensuring existing files are not overwritten.
